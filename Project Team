Principle Roles 
Niall Whelehan

Antoin Judge
- Android Developer
Emmanuel Ntibimenya
- Android Developer
Kieran Judge
- UX Design, QA Tester

The team are operating on a modified Agile effort. As we won't see each other every morning for our 15 minute "scrum"
it is even more important that we make sure our time is being well spent. There is a constant line of communication
open with us.

Niall is learning some Ruby to have a working backend operating on nitrous.io. He will be working closely with Antoin
and Emmanuel to make sure that the endpoints and naming conventions are the same. 

Initially, Antoin's role will be mapping the Android App to match Kieran's descriptions. Functions will be limited to
navigating to other screens within the App. 

Emmanuel will be working on any business logic in the app, including login and server communications.

Kieran's main role in the project is to design and test all stories and scenarios the app should, and should not carry
provide. 

While the above are the main roles of each team member, everyone will be taking lead on different aspects of the 
project when it comes to submissions, deadlines , etc..
